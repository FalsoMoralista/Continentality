# Continentality
> Predicting average temperatures through regression for the state of Bahia

# About
Continentality is a measure of difference between continental and marine climates which is characterized by increased range between day time and night temperatures that occurs over land compared with water. That happens because of the
specific heat of the water is many times (approx. 5) smaller compared with land which thus makes the temperature rates around them slower to change.   

The task then was to analyze the effects of continentality at the extreme points of the state of Bahia.

## Challenge
In order to do so we were provided with data from 25 cities out of 417 (**approx 6% coverage**) from which the state of Bahia is consisted. As shown below, the dataset presents information of latitude, longitude, altitude and average 
temperatures for each month from the year of 1999 to 2019. 

Our goal then was to try to build a regression model to learn how to predict average temperatures for every city in the state of Bahia given its altitude, lat, long for a given period of time (month and year).

# Models
Since we were only allowed to use regression models [...]
